            <h2>What is TecVooDoo?</h2>
            <p>TecVooDoo LLC is an independent game development and publishing company. We create games, write books, and build apps that embrace the odd, the strange, and the dark.</p>

            <p>This isn't content designed to please everyone. Some of it will make you uncomfortable. Some of it is designed to. If you're easily offended, this probably isn't for you—and that's okay.</p>

            <h2>The Vision</h2>
            <p>Games that don't play it safe. Stories that explore the uncomfortable corners of human experience. Experiences that stick with you after you close the browser or put down the book.</p>

            <p>Think Norman Rockwell meets Beetlejuice. Dark humor. Macabre themes. Technical craftsmanship wrapped in twisted packaging.</p>

            <h2>The Team</h2>
            <p>There is no team. TecVooDoo is a one-person operation—design, development, writing, art direction, business, everything. It's slower this way, but it means every project is exactly what it's meant to be.</p>

            <h2>Embrace the Weird</h2>
            <p>That's not an official tagline, but it might as well be. If you've found your way here, you probably get it.</p>
