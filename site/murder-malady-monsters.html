                <p class="chapter-header">Chapter 1</p>

                <p>Aggie hugged me tighter as I began the eulogy for our parents. I picked my tiny six-year-old sister up in the church's parking lot two hours earlier. She latched on, buried her face in my neck, and refused to let go. When it was my turn to speak, I shifted her to my hip and carried her with me to the pulpit. She weighed a little less than a bushel of apples. At seventeen and in decent shape, her light weight wouldn't normally bother me, but numbness replaced the needle pricks moving over my arm after holding her for so long. I didn't intend to make a long speech and wanted out of the church as quickly as possible.</p>

                <p>Taking a quick glance at my notes, I cleared my throat. "My name is George Jethro Tavor Junior, but my family calls me Jet. I know you don't know me, but you knew my parents. I want to tell you about the greatness of my Father, George Jethro Tavor Senior and my Mom, Rebecca Margaret Tavor."</p>

                <p>A few of the audience, not sitting in quiet reverence, let out cries of, "Amen."</p>

                <p>My parents' dark mahogany coffins lay before me covered in white cloths and surrounded by lilies and evergreen wreaths. The donated fragrant flowers did little to hide the smell of formaldehyde. The formaldehyde did little to cover the scent of ash residing in my nostrils. My brother Kaden would say the ash scent was just in my head. The caskets were reminders of what we lost, of what I failed to prevent. I hugged Aggie tight for a second, took a deep breath and spoke to the audience.</p>

                <p>"Y'all knew my father as a leader in this church and a friend to many. For me, he was my first friend. When I was little, he was the type of man I thought I wanted to be when I grew up. He couldn't hunt or fish, but that didn't stop him from teaching my brother and me. Though our lessons often ended without catching any fish or shooting anything but cans, we learned lots of ways to bandage my father's many injuries from our outings."</p>

                <p>The audience contributed a few snickers and once the chuckles died, I found dozens of eyes gazing at me. The single page of notes didn't feel like enough to hide from their stares, but I lifted it in front of my face. "My father showed us the importance of protecting innocence, providing for family and actions having consequences."</p>

                <p>A few more shouts of "Amen" and some head nods made their way through the pews.</p>

                <p>I paused to shift Aggie to my other side and swap the notes to my free hand. "My mother&mdash;" Tears welled and ran down my cheeks. "My mother was my first example of unconditional love. It was her idea to adopt my brother after his dad died, but she never let any of us use the word adopted. She always said he was family, and there was more than enough love to go around. She was our teacher, our doctor, our moral compass, but above all, she was our mother."</p>

                <p>The audience traded their laughter for some watery eyes and a few sobs.</p>

                <p>"My mother showed us the importance of protecting family, and love doesn't always mean blood."</p>

                <p>A few more sobs rippled through the audience. I nodded to the Reverend, and he placed a hand on my shoulder and nodded back. He addressed the audience, "Let us pray."</p>

                <p>Heads bowed in unison, and the Reverend led them in prayer. My head never lowered. Instead, I looked upon my parents' closed caskets.</p>

                <p>I had killed them both.</p>

                <p>May they rot in hell.</p>

                <p class="chapter-header">Chapter 2</p>

                <p>After my parents' eulogy, I stood at the front steps next to the church entrance. The cool air burned my throat, and the scent of pine was everywhere. My responsibility as the oldest son was to shake everyone's hand, despite not knowing any of their names. Aggie still clung to my neck and my arms still tingled. My ass itched like crazy, but I stopped myself from scratching since I was touching other people's hands, even though I was wearing latex gloves.</p>

                <p>A woman in a pink dress whispered, loud enough for me to overhear, to another lady in a purple dress. "I never knew they had an adopted son of color. No wonder they never brought their kids to church, and can you believe all these people wearing latex gloves?"</p>

                <p>Purple dress replied, "I'm surprised George agreed to the adoption being such a...a...purist. As for the gloves, they must believe all those heathen lies about the rash."</p>

                <p>My blood was boiling, and I'm sure my tongue was nearly chewed in half. Yes, my brother was adopted, and yes, he was black, but we were closer than any blood could be.</p>

                <p>Pink dress continued her gossip, "I don't want to tell tales out of school, but I heard Sharon say Larry was admitted to the hospital."</p>

                <p>"No, for the supposed rash?"</p>

                <p>"The same," Pink dress answered.</p>

                <p>"Bless his heart. Just more to fall prey to these falsehoods. It's more likely Larry caught a rash messing around with Chastity after Bible Study last week," Purple dress said.</p>

                <p>Before they moved out of earshot, their last comment was about an ugly hat someone wore during the service. I decided not to cause a scene because what I wanted to do to the old biddies was violent, and law enforcement would get involved. As much as I wanted to defend Kaden, we couldn't chance talking to the police again. Instead, I rolled my eyes as the two ladies walked away. I told myself they were two gossips and deserved to get the rash with their attitudes. I'd seen the rash first hand, and if I could have worn a latex suit, I would have.</p>

                <p>A woman who looked like the spitting image of my mother but with gray curls and deeper lines on her face stopped and faced me. She had to look up since she was almost a head shorter. A gray-haired man with black horn-rimmed glasses took up position next to her.</p>

                <p>"Aggie, why don't you let your grandpa hold you for a while and give your brother a break," my grandmother offered in a thick southern drawl as the elderly man reached up to take her.</p>

                <p>I met my mother's parents for the first time two hours ago. "She's fine," I choked through gritted teeth. "She doesn't know you." Aggie tightened her arms around my neck into a crushing grip.</p>

                <p>A dark look crossed the older man's face, and my grandmother placed an ungloved hand on his outstretched arm. "It's ok, Harold, he's right; she doesn't know us. None of them know us."</p>

                <p>Harold, my supposed grandfather, sighed and lowered his arms.</p>

                <p>"Hey, Jet!" A shout came from the parking lot.</p>

                <p>Everyone except Aggie looked around to find the source from the parked cars and pine tree-lined lot.</p>

                <p>"Hey, Jet!" The shout came again.</p>

                <p>"Jesus Christ, Kaden! What?" I probably didn't need to shout as loud as I did, but I smiled a little when I saw my grandparents flinch. But it made Aggie cringe. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you," I whispered in her ear.</p>

                <p>A shrill woman's voice came from behind me, "Young man, I know you didn't just use the Lord's name in vain, on the front steps of this church, at your parents' funeral service."</p>

                <p>I turned to find the Reverend standing in the church entryway, giving me a very unholy look. His wife, I think her name was Constance, stood next to him, breathing hard through her nose.</p>

                <p>Damnit.</p>

                <p>Constance continued, "Do you know how disrespectful that was? Dear God! What would your mother say?"</p>

                <p>"She would probably say, help help, let me out of this box," Kaden replied darkly from behind, oh so helpfully. I swiveled, eyes wide, to find him standing next to me with a devilish smile.</p>

                <p>At Kaden's little joke, a collective gasp came from the church members around us. I think the birds stopped chirping too. Looking back around to Constance, I was sure her head was going to explode, which would surely set the massive wide-brimmed black hat she was wearing ablaze atop her head. Are those peacock feathers?</p>

                <p>Constance mimicked a fish opening and closing her mouth until she regained the power of speech. She growled and pointed at Kaden, "How dare you. You'd make jokes at your adopted parents' expense? The ones kind enough to adopt a ni&ndash;" Constance clamped her mouth, looked side to side and then leaned closer to Kaden. She gritted her teeth and continued above a whisper, "Kind enough to adopt an ungrateful so and so like you, and this is how you repay them? You better watch yourself, boy."</p>

                <p>I felt like I was going to explode all over Constance. Before I could open my mouth to defend Kaden, Kaden defended himself.</p>

                <p>"Lady...I'm not yours or anyone else's boy," Kaden said as his eyes narrowed dangerously and pointed down at Constance. Kaden is skinny but tall and imposing when he stands at his full height of six foot four. I'm six feet even and looked down at Constance, who might be a couple of inches taller than five and a half feet. Kaden looked like a giant next to her. Constance didn't flinch.</p>

                <p>Constance opened her mouth to retort, but my grandmother cut her off, "Everyone stop!" Everyone looked at her. She wore a furious look on her face, one which I'd seen a thousand times on my mother. She addressed Constance, each syllable getting louder, "You can keep your comments to yourself about him. My daughter told me," My grandmother pointed at Kaden and continued to get louder, "he's family. So be careful how you speak to my family, or I'll snatch that gaudy hat off your head and feed it to your husband through his asshole."</p>

                <p>Again, a collective gasp from all the people watching this little display. A sly smile crept onto Kaden's face as he looked back to Constance. I think he decided he liked grandmother. Constance's gloved hands reached reflexively for the brim of her hat, I guess to keep it from being snatched. She let out a snort, spun, and stalked back into the church as her heels tried to punch holes in the hardwood floors, leaving the Reverend behind with a sour look on his face. Maybe he was imagining what the hat would taste like, or more likely, imagining the discussion he would be having with Constance later.</p>

                <p>Aggie shifted in my arms and, finally, brought her head up to look around. She almost fell out of my grip when she saw Kaden and reached for him. Kaden took her without a thought and lifted her so she could place her head onto his neck. My arms tingled as if they'd been asleep.</p>

                <p>My grandfather stood silent and stone-faced through the whole exchange, but I could almost sense a glimmer of a smile in his dark slate eyes behind his thick glasses. He had my mother's eyes...my eyes. He put his hand on my grandmother's arm and said, "Margaret, let's go to the truck. We don't want to delay the procession." He nodded at me, Kaden, and then the Reverend before turning and guiding my grandmother down the stairs towards the parking lot.</p>

                <p>"Will you need a ride to the grave?" the Reverend asked. It took me a minute to realize he was speaking to me.</p>

                <p>I blinked. "Uh, no. Aggie and I'll ride with Kaden."</p>

                <p>"Very well," the Reverend said as he turned and went back into the church.</p>

                <p>"Okay, that escalated quickly," Kaden said.</p>

                <p>After the Reverend disappeared into the back of the church, I looked up at Kaden. "It could have been worse."</p>

                <p>"Screw that ashy old hag, but it is worse."</p>

                <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

                <p>"I was trying to tell you the car won't start." Kaden looked down towards my hand, which was on my ass cheek. "And stop scratching."</p>

                <p>"What the hell?" I said. "The other vehicles are already lined up. What's wrong with it?"</p>

                <p>Kaden smirked. "Oh, I don't know, could it be that The Chimera is a piece of shit 1978 Impala that's been held together with spit and tape since we got it from behind the drive-in." Kaden let out a sigh. "It doesn't matter what's wrong. It isn't going anywhere, anytime soon. When I tried to crank it, smoke billowed from the hood, and it smelled like burnt rubber."</p>

                <p>"Goddammit!" I stopped scratching my ass and slapped my hand to my forehead. "What do we do now?"</p>

                <p>A horn honked, and my grandmother pulled up to the curb in the driver's seat of a massive bright red four-door Dodge Ram dually. It looked new. "Y'all need a ride?" She said with a smile.</p>

                <p>I looked at Kaden, and he nodded. "Sure," I called back to her, and we walked towards the truck.</p>

                <p>"Kaden, sweetie, you sit behind me so you'll have more legroom." My grandmother turned to my grandfather. "Harold, you could offer your seat and sit in the back, you know."</p>

                <p>My grandfather looked at her and then at us. "No."</p>

                <p>"Y'all don't mind him. He's a stubborn bull-headed old coot." My grandmother looked back at us. "Well, come on, get in so we can get in line with the procession."</p>

                <p>After Kaden opened the truck door, he placed Aggie in the middle and helped her with the seatbelt. I walked to the other side, opened the door, and stepped onto a side rail to get in behind my grandfather. He was a little shorter than me, so I had legroom. Kaden had plenty since grandma couldn't have been more than 5 feet, with heels. I bet she gets tired climbing in this truck like she's scaling a mountain. I also bet it was funny to watch.</p>

                <p>My grandmother looked back at us, well, kind of anyway. She could barely see over the seat. "Y'all buckled in? Then let's go." She hit the accelerator hard, and we lurched back as if we were shot out of a cannon. We only traveled ten feet when she slammed on the brakes, choking us with our seat belts. A blue Toyota sedan pulled out from somewhere behind the church, and we almost T-boned it. "Mother Fucker," my grandmother yelled while laying on the horn and providing an awkwardly held single-finger salute.</p>

                <p>The Reverend was driving, and Constance was in the passenger seat of the Toyota. When the horn sounded, Constance saw nothing but a truck grill barreling down on her, and she slapped her window while her face contorted into a scream.</p>

                <p>"Hah, I bet she shit those Depends she was trying to hide in that plus-size tent of a dress," my grandma said, as she repeatedly slapped my grandfather on the arm while still eyeing Constance and grinning like a Cheshire cat.</p>

                <p>My grandfather looked down at his assaulted arm and back up at my grandmother. With as little enthusiasm as possible, he replied, "Yes, I'm sure she did." He yawned and laid his head back against the headrest.</p>

                <p>Kaden and I sat in awe, eyes wide and open-mouthed, at my grandmother's potty mouth mastery. She looked more wholesome schoolmarm type, but that image was forever shattered as she continued stringing insults at Constance in new and creative ways. I tried to interrupt to tell her the Toyota had moved on, but she hit the accelerator, and we were thrown back into the seats again.</p>

                <p>We pulled onto the tree-lined road and took a right, swinging out wide, shit, way too wide, into oncoming traffic, which caused another tirade of loud shouting and horn honking from my grandmother and from the people swerving to get out of her path. Kaden and I instinctively reached for the 'Oh-Shit' handles, and I might have prayed for the first time.</p>

                <p>My grandfather seemed asleep or, maybe, he passed out from shock. Nope, he was snoring, definitely asleep. I looked down and found Aggie's head on my arm, and she was snoring too. What the hell?</p>

                <p>"Ma'am," Kaden started, sounding very respectful, or perhaps fearful, "Ma'am, um, I think we have to pull in behind the preacher's car."</p>

                <p>My grandmother gave a glance over her shoulder instead of using the damn rearview mirror. "Thank you, Kaden. It's nice to hear you have manners."</p>

                <p>I couldn't form words yet as I pointed to the road and at the oncoming semi-truck. Finally, I regained the power of speech, "Gra...Gra...Grandma! Look out!"</p>

                <p>"Aww, you called me Grandma," she cooed as she whipped the wheel right, barely missing the horn blaring semi, and came to rest, or maybe better described as violently halted, directly behind the Toyota on the side of the road.</p>

                <p>"Jesus Christ!" I spouted as the sudden realization of how many times we almost died in the last minute hit me. Grandma looked back at us, of course, this time, she used the damn rearview mirror, you know, since we were parked. She smiled. I decided, right then, I might like Grandma too.</p>

                <p>I slowly released the white-knuckled grip on the 'Oh My God, We Are Going To Die' handle and looked at Kaden. He still had a firm death grip on his and had broken into a sweat...wuss. My grandfather snored, Aggie snored, Kaden was still staring straight ahead, not moving, maybe he was praying too, and I fell back into my seat trying to scratch my butt cheek. Grandma fixed her makeup in the mirror; at least she'd waited until we stopped moving.</p>

                <p>The hearse pulled out onto the road, followed by the Reverend and us. The rest of the cars followed after. We didn't even travel a mile before sirens blared. We pulled to the side of the road, and my body tensed up at what I knew had to be the police. My heart pounded so hard, I was sure everyone in the truck could hear it. I breathed easier when two fire trucks and an ambulance passed us, heading back the way we came. I'm sure they were responding to some unfortunate caught up in the wake of Grandma's driving skills.</p>

                <p>Once the emergency services passed, the procession moved again. We inched forward and maintained a non-imminent peril speed with the other vehicles. Grandma glanced in the mirror. "So, when did Becky start going to church?"</p>

                <p>I blinked for a second; my mother always preferred Rebecca, so hearing her called Becky sounded strange. I thought about her question and replied, "Dad started going after he lost his job. She started going with him only a few months ago."</p>

                <p>"Oh." She seemed lost in thought for a minute. "Look, George&mdash;"</p>

                <p>"Jet. No one calls me George or Jethro, and never Junior." I always hated my name, and I came to hate it even more over the last couple of weeks.</p>

                <p>Grandma didn't miss a step. "Look, Jet, I'm sorry we haven't been there for, well, for any of you. We wanted to be, but your father and us didn't get along."</p>

                <p>"It's fine." I didn't want to have this conversation right now.</p>

                <p>"No, it isn't fine, Harold and I wanted to be in your lives, but we were never allowed."</p>

                <p>I stared out my window, watching the pines and kudzu on the roadside race by providing the fields and orchards cover from the road. Several trees and patches of grass were covered in yellow spots. I sighed, "I said it's fine; we don't need to talk about this right now." I realized taking a ride with my grandparents meant we were a captive audience and a way to vent their guilt.</p>

                <p>Something she said earlier popped into my head. "Back at the church, you mentioned our mother told you about Kaden, that he's family." I turned my head from the window to look towards her. "When did you speak to her?"</p>

                <p>My grandfather woke up and placed his hand on the back of Grandma's arm, rubbing lightly. I could see her eyes in the mirror. They were misty under her blue horn-rimmed glasses. "We've been talking for about a month." She let out a breath as if she'd been holding it.</p>

                <p>"Why?" It was all I could think to say.</p>

                <p>My grandfather turned his head to look down at Aggie sleeping and then turned to face me. "She was planning on leaving your father and bringing you, Aggie, and Kaden to live on our farm down in Dalenton. It's about 150 miles southwest from here."</p>

                <p>My stomach tied itself in a knot and bile burned the back of my throat. Kaden and I locked wide eyes and stared at each other. Without breaking eye contact with Kaden, I asked again, "Why?"</p>

                <p>My grandfather turned his head to look out his window. "Becky was a good kid. We loved her very much. We were excited for her when she met your father, and she seemed genuinely happy." He turned his head to face grandma, still rubbing the back of her arm. "We didn't see the gradual control your father was exerting over her until it was too late."</p>

                <p>A flash of anger hit me. He was talking about my father. "What do you mean? My father loved my mother!" Heat radiated off my face like it was on fire. "And she hated being called Becky, by the way."</p>

                <p>"Fine, Rebecca," my grandfather conceded. "Your father did love her in his way," he continued, "but he was also controlling and manipulative. He removed everyone from your mother's life that might have offered her a differing opinion or support."</p>

                <p>My grandfather was talking about my mother like she was an abuse victim. I remember her laughing at my father's horrible jokes at the dinner table. I remember they spent time together around the house and went on dates. "My father was her whole world outside Aggie, Kaden, and myself," I replied, furious at myself for defending either of my parents.</p>

                <p>"Exactly, when Beck&mdash;" my grandfather stopped and looked at me before correcting, "When Rebecca and your father started dating, her time with anyone else diminished and finally stopped altogether. She became isolated in her room and only went out when George would pick her up. When she turned eighteen, your father and mother eloped. They moved here and in with his parents."</p>

                <p>"And you decided what, oh well, not our problem anymore?" I asked, more than a little irritated.</p>

                <p>My grandfather turned back towards his window. "We tried to get her back, but a restraining order was filed. We ignored the order, but George's father was a cop. The police told us we had no rights since they were married. George met us at a diner once and threatened us by threatening your mother's life. He said he would kill her if we came back, and we believed him. We tried through legal means a few more times over the years, but never with any success."</p>

                <p>The blinker clicked as my grandmother signaled a right turn, and the procession turned onto a very narrow dirt road. The truck shuddered as it hit the rough terrain, and Aggie woke up grabbing my arm. With Aggie awake, we settled into an awkward silence. My grandfather continued staring out his window. Grandma stayed focused on her driving, thank God. Kaden was looking out his window, remaining uncharacteristically quiet, and I continued to think about what my grandfather said while attempting to scratch my ass cheek.</p>

                <p>My mother didn't have friends come over or friends outside of the church. Since Sunday was our father's designated cleaning day, Kaden, Aggie, and I weren't allowed to go to church with them. Friends never seemed important to my mother. She wasn't a prisoner, she took us for ice cream, went shopping with us at The Salvation Army, and well, that was it. She didn't go anywhere by herself.</p>

                <p>My father did go places alone, primarily to work at the church. We only had one car, except for our poorly running Impala.</p>

                <p>We were our mother's jobs. I was homeschooled by my mother even before the rash started spreading. I was eleven once Aggie came along. Kaden came to live with us after his dad died when I was thirteen. Kaden's mother died during his childbirth, and he had no other family. We were the only kids our age within five miles, and since he only lived half a mile away, we became friends. My mother never questioned if he should stay with us, despite my father's objections. They adopted him and pulled him out of public school, homeschooling him with Aggie and me.</p>

                <p>Kaden had a tough time at first since we weren't allowed to have electronics, but he became used to it. Kaden said the curriculum my mother taught was very advanced, like college material, compared to public school and my mother always spent extra time tutoring each of us. So, yeah, we were always around, and my mother was never alone. We weren't allowed communication with the outside world, hmph, maybe she was a prisoner, perhaps we all were.</p>

                <p class="chapter-header">Chapter 3</p>

                <p>Grandma broke the awkward silence. "How far is the cemetery? Jet, why are you squirming back there? Do you have ants in your pants?"</p>

                <p>Kaden smiled at me, showing all his teeth, saying, "Um, Ma'am, we have no map," then pointed at me, "He has a rash, but I think the ants are gone." I shot Kaden an 'eat shit and die' look.</p>

                <p>"Have y'all ever been to this part of town, maybe with some friends?" Grandma took her eyes off the road, looked back at us, and seemed to ignore the 'rash' comment.</p>

                <p>Hoping to get her attention back on the road, I said, "No, we were never allowed to go anywhere with anyone but Mom and Dad, and they never brought us around here."</p>

                <p>Grandma yelled, "What!" The truck swerved back and forth, barely missing passing traffic. "How could two...How old are you? Seventeen, right?" We nodded. "How could two seventeen-year-old boys survive without going anywhere without friends? Mary would go crazy without her entourage."</p>

                <p>"I guess you can't miss what you never had," I replied a bit sheepishly. "And who is Mary?"</p>

                <p>My grandfather turned his head towards us. "Mary is technically your aunt, but she's only a year older than you."</p>

                <p>"You mean she's your daughter?" I asked, trying to process this new information.</p>

                <p>Grandma answered proudly, "Yes, my baby factory was still working eighteen years ago. The stars aligned or some fairy godmother type used magic to make it happen, but Grandpa Harold smoked some weed, and when he does, well, let me tell you, he's like a bull in a China shop, and I'm the China. I still say it was the new position we were trying, I felt like I had wings and&mdash;"</p>

                <p>"Stop," I pleaded, really, really, not wanting to have this conversation. "That's not an appropriate conversation for, um, Aggie." Aggie looked up with an eyebrow raised and a smug little smirk, a look way too old for a six-year-old. Damn, she already has a mom glare. She turned that look on Kaden, and he raised both his eyebrows and pushed farther into his seat.</p>

                <p>If the topic phased my grandfather, he didn't show it. If anything, he looked like he was going to fall asleep again. Grandma continued to smile and added, "You should not be embarrassed to talk about sex&mdash;"</p>

                <p>"Please, stop," Kaden pleaded this time.</p>

                <p>She didn't stop.</p>

                <p>"I mean, especially at our age. The older you get, the more you have to rely on vacuum pumps and high-quality lubricants&mdash;"</p>

                <p>"So, where's Mary now?" I asked, trying to change the subject.</p>

                <p>Grandma didn't get a chance to answer the question; instead, she slammed on the brakes and let out another loud, "Mother Fucker!" We all lunged violently forward in our seats. She stopped the truck before running into the Reverend's car. I looked up to see the hearse pull into a half circle driveway in front of a rusty mobile home. The Reverend pulled in behind the hearse, and we stopped behind him. The rest of the procession was still on the road behind us. The driver of the hearse opened his door and headed for the trailer. The front door swung open to reveal a very grizzly-looking good ole boy in hunting camos and a shotgun, leveled at the hearse driver.</p>

                <p>"Oh shit," Kaden and I chorused. I rolled down my window.</p>

                <p>The hearse driver immediately threw his hands up in surrender and stuttered, "Wa...Wait, old-timer, please don't sh...shoot! I...I just need directions."</p>

                <p>The grizzly man racked his shotgun with seasoned skill, and the distinct sound of the shell chambering demanded attention. We were all paying attention, and the driver became a statue.</p>

                <p>"Maybe you shouldn't be insulting me if you're wantin my help. I don't appreciate the term old-timer. It's offensive." The grizzly man's nose wrinkled, and his top lip pulled into a sneer. "Son, did you pee yourself? That's just plain nasty."</p>

                <p>After a minute of the driver composing himself, he pleaded, "S...S...Sir, please I...I meant no offense."</p>

                <p>"Well, offense taken, son." Grizzly looked strangely comfortable holding the shotgun on the hearse driver. "What're you going to do to rectify this inconvenience to my person?" The hearse driver dropped to his knees, lowered his head, and begged.</p>

                <p>Grandma shattered the silence in the truck. "Harold, are you going to stop this, or do I have to do it?"</p>

                <p>My grandfather looked at her with an evil smile. "I was going to see how far this would go, but since you're in a hurry." He opened his door, stepped out, and walked towards the grizzly man.</p>

                <p>"That's far enough," Grizzly said and swung the gun in my grandfather's direction.</p>

                <p>My grandfather stopped and asked, "Hey there, is that a Winchester 25?"</p>

                <p>Grizzly blinked for a minute, smiled, and responded, "Yeah, it is. It was my pa's, and it still works as well as it did in the '50s." Grizzly lowered the gun. "What's all this about? I thought he," Grizzly pointed at the hearse driver, "was trying to collect a debt and using the hearse as a scare tactic."</p>

                <p>"You must owe some interesting people if you think they would show up in a hearse," my grandfather replied and then let out a laugh. "No, Sir, we're trying to find a graveyard. We're burying my daughter and her husband today."</p>

                <p>The grizzly man came down the steps and stuck out his ungloved hand to my grandfather. "Sir, my name is William Reeds, but you can call me Bill. My sincerest condolences for your loss. I've a daughter of my own. She's dumber than dog shit, but I'd be lost if something happened to her. Did they die in a car wreck? I figured that's why they're being buried together."</p>

                <p>"Nice to meet you, Bill. My name is Harold Claret. It wasn't a car accident, but a house fire," my grandfather said as he grasped Bill's hand and gave it a firm shake. "Thank you for the sentiment too. Is there any way you can tell us how to get to the Coal River Cemetery?"</p>

                <p>Grizzly pointed to the hearse driver. "That fool has taken you thirty miles in the wrong direction. You'll have to go back yonder to the main road, turn right, and keep going about fifteen miles until you see a large white cross. After the cross, turn left onto another dirt road, then it's about a mile down after that."</p>

                <p>"Thank you for the help, Bill, and sorry for giving you such a start." My grandpa took a red card out of his jacket and handed it to Bill, saying, "If you're ever down my way, give me a call, and I'll see about rectifying that inconvenience against your person."</p>

                <p>Bill looked at the business card and back up at my grandfather, smiling. "Well, yes, sir. This might be worth a trip."</p>

                <p>My grandfather and Bill shook hands again, and my grandfather turned to look at the hearse driver asking, "Did you get those directions, or do I need to write them down?"</p>

                <p>"I heard, thank you, I'll get us there," the hearse driver shakily stood and climbed back in the hearse.</p>

                <p>Back in the truck, my grandfather threw a single wave at Bill. "Wake me when we get there," and laid his head back on the headrest.</p>

                <p>The hearse pulled out of the driveway and turned back the way we came. Every car in the procession followed us as they made their way into Bill "Grizzly" Reeds' circular driveway to turn around. No one spoke in our vehicle, and I noticed many angry-looking procession drivers as we passed. Deep ditches lined the road on both sides and it was barely wide enough to allow for one car, much less two vehicles passing each other, so the trip back to the main road took three times as long.</p>

                <p>When we finally turned right onto the main road, Grandfather and Aggie were asleep again. Kaden and I were looking out our respective windows. Grandma looked up into the mirror at me, then Kaden, and asked, "Do y'all mind some music?" Kaden and I shook our heads. I was genuinely curious as to what type of music she would like. Grandma turned on the radio, and John Fogerty was singing in his unique Californian Southern Louisiana blues style about an ominous moon foreshadowing death if you went outside.</p>

                <p>Everyone still awake remained quiet until we saw the large white cross on the side of the road. Kaden said, "Wow, I was expecting one of those small crosses placed when there's a car accident. That cross is taller than our house." He flinched a little after he said it and looked at me. "Well, taller than our house was, sorry." I nodded my agreement at the estimation of the cross' height and the apology. It was my fault the house was gone.</p>

                <p>Grandma looked in the mirror at us a few times before saying, "Your Grandfather and I would like to honor Rebecca's last wish and invite the three of you to stay with us."</p>

                <p>"No," I said quickly. Kaden shot me a frowned look.</p>

                <p>"Can I ask why?" Grandma asked.</p>

                <p>I looked at Kaden and then back into the mirror. "We'll be fine; we have a plan."</p>

                <p>Grandma's eyes squinted. "You have no house, you're both only seventeen, and I'm guessing no money. So, what's your plan?"</p>

                <p>"It's private." Kaden and I did have a plan. There was a small shed on the property that stored a generator. We could continue working in the orchards for money and save until we build a new house. Kaden and I graduated from our homeschooling this past year. We knew the curriculum and where to submit Aggie's work to get credit. We had a plan.</p>

                <p>"Private? Well, that's evasive," Grandma retorted, "So what're you going to do about Aggie?"</p>

                <p>My eyes narrowed as I leaned forward in my seat. "What about her? She's staying with us."</p>

                <p>My grandmother shook her head and sighed. "Sorry, no, she won't be staying with you. She'll be&mdash;"</p>

                <p>"She'll stay with us, and she's not going with you!" Aggie woke up and gripped Kaden's arm at my shout. My grandfather raised his head and looked back at me with one eyebrow reaching for his receding hairline. Kaden leaned forward in his seat, eyes narrowed, mouth set in a thin line, looking like he was about to explode. Good. He was on my side in this.</p>

                <p>Grandma's bittersweet smile flashed in the mirror. "It isn't us you have to worry about. You're not eighteen and have no legitimate means to support yourselves. Social services will get involved," she looked in the mirror at Aggie. "You won't be able to fight once they bring the law with them. So that leaves you with one choice, to run, and that's not a good life for anyone, especially not a child."</p>

                <p>I opened my mouth to respond, but nothing came out. I deflated into my seat and looked at Kaden. The look of fury on his face morphed into worry. We never considered anyone taking Aggie away in all the planning we did.</p>
